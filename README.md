# Beware the Freeze

## About
Every year, my irrigation pipes freeze and I have to replace the ($$$) value because I didn't wrap them before the first freeze of the year.  This app will let you enter some info like your email and zipcode and will notify you before the first freeze.  This is from the civic hackathon in Q4 2013.

## Installation
This is a Rails app using Postgres.

You will need to sign up for an API key from [Forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/ "Forecast.io") and then provide that as an environment variable named `FORECAST_IO_API_KEY`
